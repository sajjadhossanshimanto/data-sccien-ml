🎯 𝗧𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆'𝘀 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗻 Learning ML : Pandas Missing Value
In today's lesson, I learned 2 methods to deal with missing data in pandas.
1. 𝗱𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗻𝗮 ->  drops all the rows containing any nan value.
2. 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗻𝗮    ->  I imagine this as a replace function. that replaces 𝘯𝘢𝘯 with the provided value.

Filtering NAN values is a crucial step in data analysis. For example, we replaced NaN with zero to avoid errors when calculating the sum.
